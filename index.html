          <p1>
            A frappé coffee is a Greek iced coffee drink made from instant coffee, water, sugar, and milk. The word is often written frappe.
            The frappé was invented through experimentation by Dimitris Vakondios,
            a Nescafe representative, in 1957 in Thessaloniki. Frappés are among the most popular
            forms of coffee in Greece and Cyprus and have become
            a hallmark of postwar outdoor Greek coffee culture. <br>
            <br> INGREDIENTS FOR A HOMEMADE COFFEE FRAPPE: <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Instant Espresso Coffee</li>
              <li>Milk</li>
              <li>Ice</li>
            </ul> 
            <br> First, you’re going to prepare the espresso and then chill it until completely cooled down.
            <br> Next step is to combine the espresso, milk, sugar and ice in a blender.
            <br>
            Then, begin to blend on low speed, slowly increasing the speed to high, and blend until smooth
            <br>
            Pour into glasses and serve right away.

        <p1>
          A cappuccino is an espresso-based coffee drink that originated
          in Austria and was later popularized in Italy and
          is prepared with steamed milk foam.
          <br> <br> 
          <br>INGREDIENTS FOR A HOMEMADE COFFEE CAPPUCCINO: <br> <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Ground espresso</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
          </ul>
          <br> Make around 35ml espresso using a coffee machine and pour it into the base of your cup.
          <br> Steam the milk with the steamer attachment so that it has around 4-6cm of foam on top.
          Hold the jug so that the spout is about 3-4cm above the cup and pour the milk in steadily.
          As the volume within the cup increases, bring the jug as close to the surface of the drink as possible
          whilst aiming to pour into the centre. Once the milk jug is almost touching the surface of the coffee,
          tilt the jug to speed up the rate of pour. As you accelerate, the milk will hit the back of the cup and start naturally folding
          in on itself to create a pattern on the top.
          Dust the surface with a little cocoa powder if you like.
